Welcome to the **n8n_50-50_challenge** repository! Here, I share my journey of creating 50 AI-powered automations over 50 days using n8n. My name is Sai Akhil, and as an AI/ML Developing Engineer, I aim to simplify my daily tasks. Why do the same repetitive tasks when you can automate them?

## About the Challenge

I started this challenge because I often find myself overwhelmed with repetitive tasks. Instead of spending valuable time on them, I decided to build automations that genuinely save time. Each automation focuses on real-world problems and uses accessible tools. 

## Why n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect various apps and services. It is user-friendly and flexible, making it ideal for building automations without extensive coding knowledge. I chose n8n for this challenge because it empowers users to create custom workflows that suit their specific needs.

## The Automations

Each day, I will document an automation I build, detailing the problem it solves, the solution, and the time saved. Below are the automations I've completed so far.

### Day 1: Smart Email Classifier

**Problem:** Drowning in emails, missing important messages.  
**Solution:** An AI-based system reads emails, identifies urgency, stars important ones, and drafts responses.  
**Time Saved:** 2+ hours daily.
